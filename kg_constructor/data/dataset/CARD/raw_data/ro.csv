catalyze,catalyze,"enzymes that facilitates the movement of transposons"
confers_resistance_to,confers_resistance_to,"A relationship ontology term in which the subject (e.g. a gene family) confers or contributes to antibiotic resistance to the object (e.g. a drug class). It is a qualitative measure of antibiotic resistance, based on an experiment illustrating elevated MIC even outside of a clinical setting."
confers_resistance_to_drug,confers_resistance_to_drug,"A relationship ontology term in which the subject (usually an enzyme, protein or other gene product) confers or contributes to clinically relevant resistance to a specific antibiotic drug."
derives_from,derives_from,"(paraphrased) A relationship ontology term in which the subject has its origins from the object."
has_part,has_part,"(paraphrased)  A core relation that holds between a whole and its part. The subject has_part object."
is_a,is_a,"(paraphrased) An axiomatic relationship ontology term in which the subject is placed into a higher order classification."
participates_in,participates_in,"A relation between a continuant and a process, in which the continuant is somehow involved in the process, e.g., this input material (or this output material) participates in this process."
part_of,part_of,"(paraphrased) A relationship ontology term in which the subject is but part of the object."
regulates,regulates,"A relationship ontology term in which the subject regulates expression of the object."
relationship,relationship,"A relationship between two ontology terms."
represses,represses,"A relationship between a transcriptional regulator and a gene or gene product, in which the regulator is plays a negative role in the transcriptional process."
targeted_by,targeted_by,"A relationship ontology term in which the subject is targeted by the object (usually a class of antibiotics)."
targeted_by_drug,targeted_by_drug,"A relationship ontology term in which the subject is targeted by a specific antibiotic."
